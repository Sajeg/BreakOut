## Play it
If you want to try it, you can go to releases and **download** the newest version. Then **unzip** it and **double click** the ``*.exe`` or the ``*.x86_64`` file.

## Build it
If you want to build it yourself you need to download the project and create a ``config.cfg`` that contains the follwing:
```
[API]
